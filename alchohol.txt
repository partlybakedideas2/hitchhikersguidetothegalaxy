Alchohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by fermentation of sugars.The best alchoholic drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. When you drink it, it feels like getting your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick. 
HOW TO MIX PAN GALACTIC GARGLE BLASTER:
Take one bottle of ol' janx spirit.
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Sangtraginus V 
Allow three cubes of  Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or benzine is lost.)
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble trough it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the marshes of Fallia.
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heavy odors of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.
Sprinkle Zamphuor.
Add an olive.
Drink...but...very carefully...*

*Note: It is advised to be near a pan galactic rehabilitation center while drinking.
